    <h2>About MCmillans Pet Service</h2>
    <p>Over the years, my family and I have brought much joy into the homes of so many. Our  puppies are raised in an environment of love, hence they grow to make really great companions. I remember when I had my first  Puppy, i was only 12 and till date, that day will be one of the best days of my life. At such a tender age i learned how it felt like to be responsible and care for the little pup. I did get help from my parents but I did most of the work. I must say, it really helped shaped my character and he was my best friend. Ever since then, i have always had a puppy around me. Except when i went off to college. Even still, my friend who owned a shih tzu, would often invite me over to their house for weekends. It was really fun. Now that i am all grown and have a family, I would advice any one out there to get a puppy most especially for their kids. Owning a puppy at a tender age made me understand the act of caring.
