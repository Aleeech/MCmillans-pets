        <p>Dealing with the loss of my previous Puppy has been very difficult.  After so many years of waiting, i am glad i got one from you. Just the fact that all of your puppies are home raised is a plus for me. You must really take good care of them because i took my lil baby to my vet and everything checks out!

          Writing about Desie. I just wanted to send you pictures of the prettiest girl around. Everybody loves her, I personally can't get enough of her, thanks for all the advice you gave. She just can't stop running around, my home has been filled with joy since her arrival; looking forward to sending you more news of how she is doing
